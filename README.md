**Image Slideshow**       
This project is a simple hero section that includes a background image slideshow, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can navigate through the images by clicking "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The project was designed as a learning exercise to enhance web development skills.

**Features**    
- The hero section features a background image slideshow.   
- There are Next and Previous buttons that allow users to switch between images.    
- The slideshow transitions smoothly between images.

**Technologies Used**    
- HTML: Used for structuring the hero section and the navigation buttons.    
- CSS: Used for styling the hero section, images, and buttons.     
- JavaScript: Used to control the slideshow behavior and handle button clicks for image navigation.   

**Purpose of the Project**    
The project was created to practice front-end web development skills. It helped me understand how to:    
- Use JavaScript for DOM manipulation.    
- Handle events like button clicks.     
- Dynamically change images and add smooth transitions.    

**How to Use the Project**    
- Download or clone the project files.    
- Open the index.html file in a browser.    
- Use the Next and Previous buttons to move through the slideshow images in the hero section.   

**Future Enhancements**     
- I plan to add an autoplay feature that automatically rotates the images.   
- I might improve the design with more advanced CSS animations.
